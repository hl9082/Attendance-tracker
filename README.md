## Inspiration After having read several news about children missing on buses, I decided that I had to do something.

## What it does It keeps track of students' basic information, including facial characteristics, to ensure that they're not being missed on the trips.

## How we built it We can use Visual Studio Code, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Modus API framework, Neo4js, React.js, and more to build it.

## Challenges we ran into Since this project is fresh, it will take lots of time. Also, it's not easy to recognize correctly the biometrics of students, especially in the case of twins.
